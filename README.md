This is a collection of my personal projects. Below you will find a short description of the corresponding project and a link to a demo of the project on YouTube.

1. Game Deal Tracker - The Game Deal Tracker project was my first bigger scale project that leverages React. The application allows the user to peruse a list of games that are on sale, tracked across 30 different stores like Steam, Humble Store, and Gamesplanet. When clicking on a specific listing, the user will be presented with a list of all of the different deals tied to that game. When a user clicks on a specific deal, it will re-route them to that store's site. This data is pulled from the [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/). Features of the site include loading more deals when a user clicks the next page button, filtering deals by different criteria, searching for specific games, dark mode, and responsive design.
   - List of technologies used:
     - HTML
     - CSS

   - What I learned:
     - How to fetch data from an API and visually present that to a user
     - How to use React Router to create a layout with nested pages
     - How to work with useState to manage the state of data
     - How to work with useEffect to re-render the page, e.g., when data is pulled or a filter is applied
     - How to work with useRef to tag certain elements and tie them to event handlers and useEffect
     - How to utilize createContext to create a context of data that is provided to nested pages to be used
     - Strengthen my understanding and experience working with arrays - mapping and comparing data
